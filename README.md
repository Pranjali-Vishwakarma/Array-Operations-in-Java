# Array-Operations-in-Java

This repository contains Java programs that provide utility functions for working with arrays, including operations such as separating even and odd numbers, finding the closest pair of numbers, and converting between arrays and ArrayLists.

## Features
- **User Input Handling:** Takes integer inputs from the user.
- **Odd and Even Separation:** Splits an array into even and odd numbers.
- **Smallest Neighboring Difference:** Finds two adjacent numbers with the smallest difference.
- **Array to ArrayList Conversion:** Converts arrays to ArrayLists and vice versa.

## Files
- **ArrayFunctions.java:** Implements core array manipulation functions.
- **UserInput.java:** Handles user input and collects an integer array.
- **Main.java:** Serves as the entry point and integrates all functions.
